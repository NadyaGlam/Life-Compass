# Life Compass

Life Compass is a **FastAPI-based backend project** that generates an explainable **purpose and development profile** using precise astronomical calculations of lunar nodes.

The goal of the project is **not astrology as belief**, but an engineering-style experiment:  
translating **astronomical node positions** into structured life-direction logic — with all calculations deterministic, transparent, and defensible at interview level.

---

##  Key Features

- **FastAPI backend** with clean, modular architecture  
- **Swiss Ephemeris (pyswisseph)** as the single source of astronomical truth  
- Deterministic calculations (no randomization, no tables by date)  
- Explainable business logic layered on top of raw astronomical data  
- Portfolio-level backend project

##  What the API Calculates

Based on **date, time, and place of birth**, the service computes:

-  **South Node** – habitual patterns and comfort zone  
-  **North Node** – development vector and growth direction  
-  **Node sign axis** – qualitative direction of growth  
-  **Node house axis** – life areas where purpose is lived  

Only lunar nodes are used.  
No aspects. No additional planets.  
All calculations are performed via **Swiss Ephemeris**, not simplified tables.

##  Purpose Model

The purpose profile is built as a clear axis:

1. **South Node sign** → default strategies and familiar behavior  
2. **South Node house** → where these patterns usually play out  
3. **North Node sign** → qualities to consciously develop  
4. **North Node house** → life domain where growth happens  

The result focuses on:
- transition logic (from → to)  
- growth recommendations  
- risks of staying in autopilot  
- human-readable explanation

### Response (example)

```json
{
  "title": "Sagittarius South Node (9th House) → Gemini North Node (3rd House)",
  "bridge": "From absolute truth → to dialogue.",
  "sections": [
    {
      "focus": "☋ South Node in Sagittarius",
      "meaning": "A tendency toward certainty, teaching others, and abstract worldview thinking."
    },
    {
      "focus": "☋ South Node in the 9th House",
      "meaning": "Living through beliefs, ideologies, and theoretical frameworks.",
      "direction": "from certainty → to curiosity"
    },
    {
      "focus": "☊ North Node in Gemini",
      "meaning": "Growth through listening, asking questions, and exchanging perspectives."
    },
    {
      "focus": "☊ North Node in the 3rd House",
      "meaning": "Development unfolds through communication, learning, and everyday dialogue.",
      "direction": "from monologue → to conversation"
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Practice curiosity instead of certainty.",
    "Develop growth through communication and learning.",
    "Notice when abstract beliefs replace real dialogue.",
    "Keep the core transition in mind."
  ],
  "motto": "Truth is born in dialogue."
}
